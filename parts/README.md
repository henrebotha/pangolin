# Parts

In this document, the term "2D parts" refers to parts that would typically manufactured from sheets or panels, e.g. laser cutting acrylic. "3D parts" refers to parts that would typically be manufactured in three dimensions, e.g. 3D printed, CNC milled, carved by hand from wood, etc.

In 2D, you will find DXF files that are compatible with most laser cutting services. The files there are all to be cut from 1–2 mm aluminium (or a similarly strong material), except for the one with `Acrylic` in the name, which is to be cut from 1–4 mm acrylic (or any other aesthetically-pleasing material that feels good to the touch).

In 3D, you will find an STL file that can be used to 3D print the part. It may also be possible to produce it through CNC machining or other techniques. If you choose to 3D print it, favour structural soundness over aesthetics; it's an internal part, so you won't see it, and it has to hold the switch plate up against your playing, so it needs to be strong. SLS PA12 is a good option.
