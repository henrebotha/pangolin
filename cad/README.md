# CAD files

In this document, the term "2D parts" refers to parts that would typically manufactured from sheets or panels, e.g. laser cutting acrylic. "3D parts" refers to parts that would typically be manufactured in three dimensions, e.g. 3D printed, CNC milled, carved by hand from wood, etc.

The `cad` directory contains the FreeCAD project used to design the 2D parts. It was produced using [realthunder's branch of FreeCAD](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/tree/LinkStage3), which is a version that has many usability improvements over the mainline version. However, it may be deprecated soon. It is unclear at this moment whether mainline FreeCAD will be able to open the project files; if you try to do so and are unable, please create an issue on GitHub.
